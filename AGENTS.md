# Adventure Builder Adventures – Agent Notes

## Purpose
This repo contains Adventure Builder adventure content. Use this guide to extract example adventures from the PDF cache and create new kid-friendly adventures that follow the same structure.

## Working Directory
- Repo root: `/home/pete.levasseur/personal/adventure-builder-adventures`
- Cache PDF: `cache/Adventure_Builder_A_Family_Roleplaying_Game.pdf`
- Adventure output folder: `adventures/`

## Extracting Example Adventures
1. Extract text from the cached PDF (preferred tool: `mutool draw -F text`).
2. Locate the four sample adventures in Chapter 4:
   - The King is Missing
   - The Dragon and the Talking Pig
   - Captain No‑Beard’s Fishy Treasure Map
   - Wayzle’s Puzzle Door
3. Capture each adventure’s structure:
   - Adventure Hook
   - Story Card 1
   - Story Card 2
   - Story Card 3
   - Conclusion
4. Note placeholders like `(candy name)`.

## Creating New Adventures
- Use the same structure: Hook + 3 Story Cards + Conclusion.
- Aim for ages 6–12; emphasize non‑violent, creative solutions.
- Include clear goals in each section.
- Favor animal‑friendly or fantastical themes when requested.
- Keep language simple, playful, and flexible for a Guide to improvise.

## Writing Output
- Save new adventures as Markdown files in `adventures/`.
- Include short Guide Notes with tips on traits/solutions.
