# The Moonlit Menagerie

A kid-friendly Adventure Builder story featuring fantastical animals. Designed for ages 6–9.

## Adventure Hook: The Missing Lantern
The Moonlit Menagerie is a traveling parade of magical animals that only appears under the full moon. Tonight, the parade has stopped at the edge of town, but everything is dim and scattered. A wise little owl named Orin swoops down and explains that the Guiding Lantern was lost during a gusty wind. Without it, the animals can’t find their way back to the Moonlit Meadow before moonrise ends.

Orin asks the heroes to track down the lantern and return it before the moon sets. He offers a hint: hoofprints that sparkle with moonlight lead toward the Forest of Echoing Hooves.

**Goal:** Reach the Forest of Echoing Hooves and find the trail.

## Story Card 1: The Crystal Deer
In the Forest of Echoing Hooves, the heroes find a clearing where sounds repeat in a gentle echo. A crystal‑antlered deer steps out of the mist. She says she saw the Guiding Lantern carried away by a playful pack of cloud‑foxes. They were leaping across the treetops and heading toward the River of Floating Lilies.

The deer warns that the foxes aren’t mean; they are curious and easily distracted. She gives the heroes a small bell made from a moonstone and tells them it can catch the foxes’ attention if rung gently.

**Goal:** Reach the River of Floating Lilies and find the cloud‑foxes.

## Story Card 2: The Cloud‑Foxes and the Dim Lantern
At the river, lily pads float like tiny rafts. The heroes spot the cloud‑foxes playing tag on the water’s surface. The foxes admit they borrowed the lantern to help their kits cross the river safely, but it slipped and got wet. Now it’s glowing only faintly.

The foxes promise to return the lantern if the heroes can help relight it. They’ve heard of a Sun‑Scaled Salamander that lives in the Warmstone Caves and can rekindle any light with its warm breath.

**Goal:** Travel to the Warmstone Caves and seek the Sun‑Scaled Salamander.

## Story Card 3: The Lost Friends
The Warmstone Caves glow with gentle heat. The Sun‑Scaled Salamander agrees to relight the lantern, but only after three lost animal friends are safely reunited at the cave entrance:

- **Moss‑Bear**: shy and sleepy, hiding in a patch of deep green moss nearby.
- **Star‑Bat**: giggling and swooping in circles, stuck in a high cavern nook.
- **Thunder‑Puppy**: tiny, brave, and lost in a rumbling echo tunnel.

The heroes can search, coax, and help each animal return to the entrance. Once they’re together, the salamander breathes warm light into the lantern until it shines like moonlight again.

**Goal:** Reunite the three friends and relight the Guiding Lantern.

## Conclusion: The Parade Returns
With the lantern glowing, the cloud‑foxes guide the parade back to the Moonlit Meadow. The magical animals line up, bowing their heads in thanks. Orin the owl presents each hero with a glowing feather that can light the way in dark places for one future adventure.

The Menagerie resumes its moonlit journey, and the heroes are honored as friends of the night.
